# Introduction to Data Science

Welcome to the "Introduction to Data Science" repository, where we delve into the multifaceted world of data science, equipped with knowledge from the IBM Specialization on Coursera.

This repository is a comprehensive journey through the foundational skills essential for any aspiring data scientist. It is inspired by the IBM and Coursera collaboration that introduces what data science is about and the critical role of a data scientist.

## Specialization Overview

The specialization comprises a series of courses that take you from the very basics of understanding data to the deployment and monitoring of machine learning models in a large enterprise setting. It employs a narrative story approach, which involves a hypothetical media company, to provide real-world context to the application of data science principles.

## What You'll Learn

- **Data Ingestion and Analysis**: Starting with data sources identification, exploratory data analysis, and hypothesis testing.
- **Feature Engineering and Bias Detection**: Techniques for class imbalances, dimension reduction, and bias detection using tools like IBM AI Fairness Toolkit.
- **Model Deployment**: Deployment strategies using technologies like Apache Spark, Docker containers, and IBM Watson Machine Learning.
- **AI in Production**: Monitoring model performance and conducting unit testing with tools such as IBM Watson Openscale.

## Repository Contents

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Hands-on Python code and examples used throughout the specialization.
- **Data Sets**: Simulated data sources that reflect real-world scenarios.
- **Capstone Project**: A comprehensive project that requires the application of all the skills acquired.

## Certificate of Completion

Upon finishing the specialization, learners have the opportunity to take a certification exam and earn a professional endorsement as an "IBM AI Enterprise Workflow V1 Data Science Specialist".
